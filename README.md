# Temperature Conversion Tool

This project is a simple Python 3 program (developed in Jupyter Notebook) that converts temperatures between **Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin**. It demonstrates the use of functions, user input, and formatted output while following **PEP 8** (style guide) and **PEP 257** (docstring conventions).

## Features

- **Main Branch**
  - Converts a user-provided **Fahrenheit** value into Celsius and Kelvin.

- **Feature Branch**
  - Adds functionality to accept a **Celsius** input and convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.

## Learning Goals

This project was created as part of a GitHub workflows exercise:
1. Write simple, well-documented Python code.
2. Create a new branch for added functionality.
3. Commit and push changes using GitHub Codespaces.
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) and merge into `main`.

## Usage

1. Open the notebook file in your Codespace or local environment.
2. Run the program and enter a temperature value when prompted.
3. The program will display the converted values in the other temperature units.

Example (Celsius input branch):

Enter temperature in Celsius: 25

Input Temperature: 25.00 °C
Converted to Fahrenheit: 77.00 °F
Converted to Kelvin: 298.15 K

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, if running interactively)
